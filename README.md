Project Topic: House Price Predictor

Team members: Hanfang Zhang, Wenqing Fan, Zengrui Luo

Project Summary: 

We will start with finding a dataset in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets for our project. And using Python to conduct data cleaning to remove any unnecessary and corrupted data.

First, we will import our libraries and dataset and see how data looks like. And using describe function to see data's key statistics for further steps. 

Then, we will think abut which model (such as, regression model, K-NN, Cluster, or Naive Bayes, etc.) do we need for our project to do the data analysis, since we want to make a house price predictor. And also, we will perform some visualizations such as, barplots, scatter plots, or histogram etc. 

Things we need to research: 

Making a network request for data (whether to create a web scrapper to collect all house information from website.)

Extension ideas for this project:

We will create a simple UI that can let people enter information and get an estimate of their house price. 

We need to compare our results to other data sets.
